# Pizza sales analysis project on power bi  

This project was done to help identify customer preferences, popular toppings, and peak ordering times, enabling the store to optimize inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies for increased profitability.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using statistical and visualization techniques to gain initial insights into the data, such as identifying top-selling products, sales 
  trends, and customer behavior.
* Performance Metrics: Defining key performance indicators (KPIs) like sales growth, customer acquisition, and retention rates to measure the success of the sales efforts.
* Visualization: Creating clear and compelling visualizations in tools like Tableau to communicate findings and insights to stakeholders.
* Recommendations: Drawing actionable insights from the analysis and suggesting strategies for improving sales, pricing, marketing, and inventory management.

## Insights and recommendations 

* From the above visualization we can see that the pizza store has 16.82k average revenue and to increase this revenue i believe the following measure should be put in place: Upselling and Cross-selling, Bundling,Loyalty Programs, Tiered Pricing, Limited-time Offers, Product Quality and Innovation, Add-On Services,Feedback and Surveys,
Partnerships,Customer Support and sales training.
* From the above visualization we can see the total value is 21k suggestion about partnerships and discounts would drag more orders from clients
* Sum of revenue can hit heights if the following are put into consideration which are upselling, multiple adverts, Add-On Services,Feedback and Surveys,
  Partnerships,Customer Support and sales training.
* It is very obvious that they make more sales on friday which is known to be the start of the weekend so advice on increase quantity of production would result in more revnue and to the leaset selling day which is sunday the marketing team could hit the road for publicity.
* July is the peak month with respect to revenue followed by may and to the least months which are december, september, october the follwoing can be done in those months; Seasonal Promotions and bonuses, Targeted Marketing, customer feedbacks and improve online presence.
* We can also see that the large size is the most demanded by customers and the least is the extra extra large not evening showing in the chart suggestion it should be removed as it is least requested or not even requested for at all.
* the revenue guage shows how close we are to the budget and with all advert and partnership we would meet budget in no time.
